WalkWithMe is a walk buddy. He remembers the route you’ve walked and routes you when you want to walk back.

## Why?

I sometimes dont go on really long walks cos I forget the route and get missing. It’s not a nice feeling. This app would help me take long walks without the fear of forgetting my route.


## Instructions

1. Clone project: `git clone git@github.com:Chiamaka/walk-with-me-expo.git`

2. Get your Google API key from https://console.cloud.google.com/ and insert in extra as `"GOOGLE_MAP_KEY": ${YOUR_API_KEY}`
Look here for more info: https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/configuration/#extra

3. Run project: `npm start`

Have fun :)
