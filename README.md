WalkWithMe is a walk buddy. He remembers the route you’ve walked and routes you when you want to walk back.

## Why?

I sometimes dont go on really long walks cos I forget the route and get missing. It’s not a nice feeling. This app would help me take long walks without the fear of forgetting my route.
